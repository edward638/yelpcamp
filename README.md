Web Developer Bootcamp Final Project

This was the final project for the course The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. This is a Node.js web application which functions as 
a yelp clone. The back-end of the app was created with Express.js and MongoDB, while the front-end was created with Bootstrap and EJS. 

This application also features Passport.js for authentication.
